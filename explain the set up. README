Key Components:
GUI Design:

The GUI uses components like JTextField, JSpinner, and JButton for user input and display.
Buttons allow the user to input numbers (1, 2, etc.), clear fields (DEL), and perform actions like calculating totals or resetting inputs.
Functionalities:

Number Input:
Buttons (0–9) append numbers to the cash text field when clicked, via the enter(String v) method.
Delete (DEL):
Deletes the last character entered in the cash field.
Calculate Total:
Multiplies quantities entered for menu items  by their respective prices.
The results are summed up and displayed in the total field.
Calculate Change:
Determines if the cash entered is sufficient to cover the total.
Displays the change if sufficient, otherwise shows "INVALID INPUT."
Reset (Clear All):
Resets all fields, spinners, and text fields to their default values.
Main Method:
Retrieves quantities from JSpinner components and calculates the total by multiplying each quantity by its price.
Updates the total text field with the result.
enterActionPerformed (Calculate Change):

Compares the amount in cash to total:
If cash >= total, calculates and displays the change.
Otherwise, displays "INVALID INPUT."
Components:
Text Fields:

cash: For entering the payment amount.
total: Displays the total bill.
change: Displays the calculated change.
Spinners (JSpinner):

Used to input quantities of different menu items (e.g., f, ra, o, p, a, let).
Buttons:

Number buttons (0–9) for entering payment.
DEL: Deletes the last input in cash.
ENTER: Processes the change calculation.
Reset button clears all inputs.
Pricing and Calculation Logic:
Menu items have hardcoded prices:
Fried = 50, Rice = 15, Orange = 15, Pasta = 30, Adobo = 70, Lettuce = 100.
The total is calculated by multiplying quantities (from JSpinner) by their respective prices and summing them up.
Execution Flow:
User launches the application (resto).
Inputs quantities for menu items via spinners.
Clicks the "Place order" button to compute the total bill.
Enters the payment amount using number buttons or the keyboard.
Clicks "Enter" to calculate change or validate the input.
If needed, clears inputs with the "Reset" button.
